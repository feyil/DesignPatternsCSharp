# Design Patterns with C#

Design Pattern implementations with C# (Tutorial)

Created to understand design patterns deeply. These codes written by following a series of tutorials. I am putting these to access whenever I need to recap design patterns. 

### The SOLID Design Principles

##### Single Responsibilility Principle

* A class should only have one reason to change
* Sepation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

##### Open-Closed Principle

* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

##### Liskov Substition Principle

* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

##### Interface Segregation Principle

* Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
* YAGNI - You ain't going to need it

##### Dependency Inversion Principle

* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
